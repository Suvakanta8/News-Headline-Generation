"China’s export boom eases, raising pressure for stimulus3 min read . Updated: 07 Mar 2022, 06:07 PM IST
Policy makers face tough task of hitting ambitious growth target
Policy makers face tough task of hitting ambitious growth target
HONG KONG : China’s strong export momentum ebbed slightly in the first two months of this year as the pandemic-driven global boom in demand for the country’s goods fades, adding pressure on policy makers to prop up growth through further stimulus.
Exports in January and February rose 16.3% in dollar terms from a year earlier to $544.7 billion, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. While that beat expectations of a 15% gain among economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, it still marked a slowdown from the 20.9% year-over-year increase in December.
Imports grew 15.5% year over year to $428.7 billion, down from December’s 19.5% increase and in line with the 15.4% predicted by the survey of economists.
While China bought lower volumes of energy including coal, natural gas and crude oil, prices of those commodities have surged and could climb further as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks disrupting supplies.
Economists predict that China’s trade surplus, which soared to $676 billion last year and has propelled the country’s rapid rebound from the pandemic since 2020, will provide less support for its overall economy this year.
“It is nearly impossible for China to replicate such strong export momentum this year,"" said Shuang Ding, chief economist for China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.
The country’s trade surplus will likely shrink to around $480 billion this year as export growth continues to taper off and prices of commodities such as grains and energy surge, Mr. Ding said.
Factors that economists say may drag on export growth include the gradual reopening of other countries, reducing their reliance on China’s supply chains, and an expected imminent rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve. That would erode the spending power of consumers in the West, whose appetite for items including furniture and consumer electronics has fueled Asia’s strong exports since the start of the pandemic.
After expanding by 25% last year to reach a record $28.5 trillion, global trade growth is expected to slow during the first quarter of 2022, in part as more countries run down their pandemic stimulus packages, according to forecasts by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
The war in Ukraine could exacerbate supply-chain bottlenecks and weigh on global recovery. It could hit in particular economies in the European Union, which is China’s second-largest trade partner. Standard Chartered recently cut its forecast for the region’s economic growth to 3.1% in 2022, down from 4%.
Any slowdown in the EU would damp demand for global goods and negatively affect China’s export-market outlook, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, adding that he predicts year-over-year growth in exports to slow significantly from last year’s 30% to a “high single digit"" rate this year.
China’s weakening trade momentum adds pressure on Beijing to increase stimulus to boost domestic demand and hit this year’s growth target.
On Saturday the government set a growth target of around 5.5% for this year, an ambitious goal that paves the way for more aggressive fiscal and monetary support as the country continues to deal with headwinds in the domestic economy, including a property slump and sluggish recovery in consumption.
“With the Ukraine crisis imposing downside risk to global demand, China will have to rely more on domestic demand in 2022,"" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management wrote in a note Monday. “Now the pressure is on the fiscal policy to deliver.""

In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., the European Union, the U.K., Australia and others have said they are moving to scrutinize the assets of a handful of rich and powerful Russians.
These governments say such people have profited from their close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many have spent lavishly outside Russia, boosting local economies with property purchases and other investments. Now, authorities around the world see them as a way to pressure Mr. Putin.
The scrutiny has turned a group of mostly obscure officials and businesspeople into some of the world’s most closely tracked individuals.
Some have publicly signaled they are against the war. Many of Russia’s better-known oligarchs aren’t on any governments’ sanctions lists. That is the case with Roman Abramovich, who made his money in the energy business and is the owner of British soccer club Chelsea FC. In recent days, he has offered to mediate peace efforts and said he’s looking to sell Chelsea.
What is an oligarch?
The term comes from political science. An “oligarchy"" describes a power system led by a small group of people. In recent years, the word “oligarch"" has taken on a more specific meaning when it relates to Russia, referring to the group of Russian businesspeople and officials who gained wealth and power in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Why are Western governments imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs?
The U.S. has sanctioned many of these individuals in years past, including after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S., EU and U.K. have intensified restrictions and added names to their target lists.
The Biden administration has said the oligarchs provide resources to support Mr. Putin’s Ukraine military campaign and must pay the price. Mr. Putin is “looking at the impact on his own economy, on his rich and wealthy oligarch friends, and on the people of Russia,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in February about the U.S. and allied sanction effort.
How did Russia’s oligarchs gain their wealth and power?
The country’s current crop of billionaires and officials accumulated wealth and power in different ways. Some of those on the sanction list are part of Mr. Putin’s inner circle; others are longtime associates; still others benefited from a wave of privatizations that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Do they all have yachts?
No, but like many superhigh-net-worth individuals, many do. French authorities Thursday seized one they said belongs to a company majority owned by Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russian oil producer Rosneft. The 280-foot yacht, the Amore Vero, was seized overnight at a shipyard in La Ciotat, on France’s Mediterranean coast. The yacht was undergoing repairs, but French authorities said arrangements were being made for it to sail urgently. Mr. Sechin is sanctioned by the US and EU. When he was sanctioned in 2014 by the U.S., he said he considered the move an endorsement of his effectiveness at Rosneft.
What are some of them saying about the Russian attack on Ukraine?
Oleg Deripaska, a raw-materials magnate who was previously sanctioned in the U.S., wrote on social media Sunday that peace “is very important."" Mr. Deripaska sued the Treasury Department in 2019 challenging his inclusion in an agency report on Russian oligarchs as well as the sanctions against him, alleging the U.S. made false accusations based on rumor and innuendo to support the sanctions. A court ruled against him last June.
Mikhail Fridman, a founder of Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private bank, was sanctioned by the EU late Monday. Mr. Fridman said that he would contest the designation and that he isn’t politically or financially connected to Mr. Putin.
“It seems to me that we have done a lot of good things, invested in companies, created a lot of jobs,"" Mr. Fridman said at a press conference from his private-equity firm’s office in London. “We will litigate to protect our reputation.""
What has President Biden said about oligarchs?
“We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets,"" Mr. Biden said Tuesday during his State of the Union address. “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.""

"Russia races to protect financial system from barrage of sanctions4 min read . Updated: 04 Mar 2022, 10:45 AM IST
Stock trading remains halted and Moscow has announced new measures to protect economy
Stock trading remains halted and Moscow has announced new measures to protect economy
BY Georgi Kantchev | UPDATED 3? 01, 2022 03:41 ?? EST
Stock trading remains halted and Moscow has announced new measures to protect economy
Russia sifted through the financial wreckage caused by Western sanctions, as its stock market remained closed and the government announced new measures to try to limit the damage to the economy.
Sanctions imposed by the US and European nations in recent days have cut major Russian banks’ access to the dollar and other reserve currencies and will soon sever some of the lenders from the Swift global-payments messaging system.
The West has also blocked Russia’s central bank from using much of its sizable reserves to protect the economy. Meanwhile, many Western companies, including energy majors BP PLC and Shell PLC, have said they will exit their Russian investments and joint ventures.
On Tuesday, the Russian government announced a temporary ban on foreign investors exiting local assets. It wasn’t immediately clear what the decision entailed and how it would affect Western companies that have already announced they would quit Russia. The move followed a number of retaliatory measures announced by the Kremlin on Monday, including a ban on the issuance of loans by Russian residents to foreigners, and ordering exporters to sell 80% of their foreign-currency gains from exports.
The Kremlin was defiant, saying sanctions wouldn’t change Moscow’s course. “They believe that by imposing sanctions they can force us to change our position,"" President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Tuesday.
Mr. Peskov spoke of the droves of Russians who stood in line at cash points across the country in a frantic rush to get money out.
“Unfortunately, this is an emotional first reaction,"" he said. “I just want to wish everyone peace and express confidence that in fact, after a certain number of days, these emotions will subside.""
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the government would spend one trillion rubles, equivalent to around $9 billion, to buy shares in Russian companies. The central bank more-than-doubled interest rates Monday to 20% in an emergency move.
Large parts of Russia’s financial architecture remained in suspended animation as officials worked on stabilizing the system. Tuesday was also the first day that Russians were restricted from sending money to bank accounts abroad, an extreme measure to keep suddenly scarce foreign currency in the economy.
Mr. Putin signed an executive order Tuesday banning people from taking more than $10,000 of foreign currency out of the country in cash, according to state newswire TASS.
Foreigners associated with “states that take hostile actions against Russia"" will need the approval of the Russian government to transact with securities and real estate and to receive ruble loans. Mr. Putin’s decree didn’t specify which states are deemed hostile.
Trading on the Moscow Exchange was again suspended, as was business on the onshore foreign-exchange market. There was only sporadic trading of the ruble in international markets, with most banks unwilling to touch Russian assets.
The consequences of Western sanctions reverberated outside Russia, where companies that provide vital financial plumbing unplugged the country from the grid.
Russian government bonds disappeared from trading screens after a top bond platform, Tradeweb, suspended trading of the securities, citing Western sanctions.
Clearinghouse operator Euroclear prepared to stop investors from clearing trades involving ruble-denominated securities. Euroclear’s competitor, Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream unit, said Monday, it would stop settling domestic trades in Russia, accepting rubles as a settlement currency and settling trades for various Russian-linked stocks and bonds. Clearing and settling is a necessary cog to trade securities by ensuring buyers receive their purchased security and sellers get paid.
The Swift system said Tuesday that it was ready to eject Russian banks covered by Western sanctions. “We are engaging with these authorities to understand which entities will be subject to these new measures and will disconnect them once we receive legal instruction to do so,"" the organization said.
Western banks have moved to disconnect Russian financial firms and companies from international markets. In London, Bank of New York Mellon resigned as the depository agent for VTB Bank PJSC depositary receipts traded in the British capital. Germany’s Deutsche Boerse AG said it would suspend trading after markets close Tuesday in more securities of sanctioned or Russian state-backed companies, having suspended more than 15 securities Monday, including VTB Bank and Sberbank depositary receipts.
Other banks moved to stop functions they provide around shares of some Russian companies trading on European exchanges, to meet a coming EU deadline to stop listing or providing services to state-owned entities.
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and UBS Group AG told clients they would no longer process trading of the shares of Russian companies listed on Western markets.
Banks including HSBC Holdings PLC are freezing correspondent banking with entities harshly sanctioned by the U.S. Correspondent banks provide crucial access to global currencies that Russian banks can pass to companies to conduct trade or pay suppliers. HSBC keeps sterling-denominated accounts in London for VTB and around seven other Russia-registered banks, according to data provider Intelbridge.
Switzerland’s UBS has accounts for VTB and Sberbank, and Credit Suisse supplies Swiss francs or other currencies to around 15 smaller Russian banks, according to the data, including some of those sanctioned recently.
Spokespeople for VTB, Sberbank, HSBC, UBS and Credit Suisse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
MSCI Inc. signaled it could cut Russia from widely followed equity indexes. Market assessments by MSCI and competitors such as London Stock Exchange Group PLC’s FTSE Russell unit help determine how investors allocate many billions of dollars.
On Monday, Central Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina said the country’s banking sector was experiencing a structural liquidity deficit, meaning there was a shortage of easily accessible money critical to keeping the financial system running.

"What the Russia-Ukraine crisis means for businesses7 min read . Updated: 04 Mar 2022, 09:01 AM IST
Big brewers, major oil companies, auto makers and airlines are grappling with the fallout from the attack
Big brewers, major oil companies, auto makers and airlines are grappling with the fallout from the attack
Russia’s assault on Ukraine has left Western companies scrambling to ensure the safety of their workers, while girding for disruption stemming from Western sanctions.
Many companies are now re-evaluating their businesses in Russia, with some curtailing their operations there or deciding to leave entirely. Meanwhile, some companies with facilities in Ukraine have suspended operations.
While the relatively small size of the Russian and Ukrainian economies—and the perceived difficulty of doing business there—means most multinationals have limited exposure to the countries, several large Western companies have built up businesses in both.
Even for companies not operating in the region, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heaps fresh risks on a global economy already struggling with soaring inflation and supply-chain snags amid the recovery from the pandemic.
Oil and Gas
Energy companies are among the most exposed to the region, with several major oil companies building up sizable investments in Russia. While those companies stand to benefit from higher commodity prices, they could also be among those potentially exposed to sanctions or disruption in Russia.
British energy giant BP PLC has said it plans to exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian government-controlled oil producer Rosneft, a move that came after it was pressured to unload the holding by U.K. officials. The company, which relies on Rosneft for roughly one-third of its oil-and-gas production, faces a potential loss of as much as $25 billion on the move. BP said its chief executive and former CEO have resigned from Rosneft’s board. It isn’t yet clear how BP will exit its stake.
Shell PLC also has said it will pull back from Russia. It said it would exit its joint ventures in the country with Russian company Gazprom PJSC and quit its role financing the now-halted Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Separately, Norwegian energy major Equinor ASA said it would stop new investments into Russia and start the process of exiting from its Russian joint ventures after more than 30 years in the country.
Consumer Goods
Several large consumer-goods companies have factories in Ukraine, including Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S, Swiss food giant Nestlé SA and Davidoff cigarettes maker Imperial Brands PLC. All of those companies have suspended operations in the country in recent days, calling for their staff to stay safe at home.
Philip Morris International Inc. has also said it is suspending operations in Ukraine, including its factory in Kharkiv, as Russian forces continue to attack the country.
Among the most exposed is Carlsberg, which has eight breweries in Russia. The brewer has said it generates around 10% of its overall revenue in the country. Yogurt maker Danone SA says it generates about 5% of its revenue from Russia, where it says it mostly sources, produces and sells locally, rather than sending products across borders.
Autos
Several major auto makers have operations in Russia, with some deciding to pull back in light of the conflict, and others warning of disruption to their businesses.
Volvo Car AB and truck maker Volvo AB have both halted business in Russia until further notice, with the Swedish autos brand citing “the potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and U.S.""
Daimler Truck Holding AG has said it would suspend deliveries of truck components to its Russian partner Kamaz in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
France’s Renault SA is one of the biggest players in Russia’s car market having in 2014—alongside partner Nissan Motor Co.—taken a controlling stake in AvtoVAZ, the former state-owned Lada manufacturer. The company has temporarily shut a plant near Moscow because of “some logistical issues"" stemming from Western measures against the country.
Renault’s CEO Luca de Meo recently said worsening tensions between Russia and Ukraine could lead “to another supply-chain crisis linked to parts that would have to come from abroad."" Separately, Jeep-owner Stellantis NV has said it would be prepared to shift or limit production of its vehicles in Russia if Western sanctions disrupt those operations.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen AG luxury car unit Audi has stopped selling cars that are already with dealers in Russia so it can adjust the price of the vehicles to reflect the decline in the value of the ruble. The conflict has also hindered VW’s operations in Germany, where it has stopped some production because it could no longer get wiring systems produced in Ukraine.
Auto makers, already struggling with a shortage of semiconductors, could also face additional problems if Russia’s supply of palladium were to slow.
Airlines
The fallout from the invasion has led dozens of countries to ban Russian airlines from entering their airspace, triggering reciprocal prohibitions from Moscow. While Russia is a busy route for some Western carriers, the bigger disruption comes from the restriction of Russian airspace, which is used to connect most flights between Europe and Asia.
Russia’s ban now applies to 38 countries, including all European Union members, the U.K. and Canada, meaning a swathe of airlines have had to redirect or cancel routes. Finnair Oyj, for instance, has halted flights from Helsinki to Japan, South Korea and China in response, while Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. has stopped flying a cargo route from London to Shanghai.
The political airspace bans come in addition to restrictions over safety concerns. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has instructed airlines to avoid Ukrainian airspace, as well as that of neighboring Moldova and Belarus. Aircraft also have been restricted from flying in Russia’s southwest Rostov region and in airspace within 200 nautical miles of Ukraine’s border.
Healthcare
Global pharmaceutical companies are looking to ensure that their medicines and vaccines can continue to reach Ukrainian patients. Ukraine relies heavily on medicines from overseas: Imported medicines and vaccines were worth $2.5 billion in 2020, according to United Nations trade data. The biggest share of that comes from Germany, where many large Western drugmakers have plants.
Roche Holding AG said it was continuously working to ensure patients in Ukraine and Russia had access to its medicines and diagnostics. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk A/S, one of the world’s biggest insulin makers, said it was monitoring the safety of the roughly 100 people it has in Ukraine.
Tech
In recent years, companies in the U.S. and Europe have outsourced tech services to Ukraine. Following Russia’s incursion, internet outages occurred across the country, according to a monitoring dashboard run by the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Technology companies, including German software provider SAP SE and London-based financial-technology company Revolut Ltd., as well as Israel-based services marketplace Fiverr International Ltd. and website design and development platform Wix.com Ltd., say they employ workers in the region. SAP said it had closed its Kyiv office and taken safeguarding measures to support its employees, while Wix said it evacuated employees to Poland and Turkey.
The CEO of Grammarly, a startup founded in Ukraine that aims to improve people’s writing, said he is hopeful that the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalates but that his company has also prepared for the worst. Brad Hoover said in a LinkedIn post that Grammarly “remains committed to Ukraine,"" is still hiring for various team roles and that the company has plans in place to ensure its services won’t get disrupted.
Meanwhile, U.S. tech giants have come under pressure from both Russia and the West to respond to the conflict in Ukraine.
Agriculture
U.S. agriculture companies operating in Ukraine are closing offices and facilities in the country in response to Russia’s attack. Archer Daniels Midland Co. said it has stopped operating its facilities in Ukraine, where the crop trader and processor employs more than 630 people. ADM’s Ukraine facilities include an oilseed crushing plant in Chornomorsk, a grain terminal in the port of Odessa, six grain silos and a trading office in Kyiv.
Agriculture giant Bunge Ltd., which employs more than a thousand workers in Ukraine, temporarily suspended its own operations at two processing facilities in the country.
Cargill Inc. said that an ocean vessel it chartered was hit by a projectile offshore from Ukraine on the Black Sea on Thursday. The food supplier, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is still seaworthy and no one was injured. The crew is accounted for and the ship is headed for Romania, a spokeswoman said.
Entertainment
Some of Hollywood’s biggest movie studios, including Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros., are delaying the release of highly-anticipated films in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
Still, the Russian market represents a fairly small slice of global box office receipts.
Other corners of the American entertainment industry have also cut ties with Russia since the invasion. Rock band Green Day canceled a concert scheduled for the end of May in Moscow, and venue development and investment firm Oak View Group said it was severing all connections to Russia, even down to the Russian alcohol it served in its buildings.

"China opposes sanctions and has a reputation for busting them6 min read . Updated: 06 Mar 2022, 06:23 PM IST
Sanctions on Russia for Ukraine war could prove less effective if China offers market access
Sanctions on Russia for Ukraine war could prove less effective if China offers market access
Under international agreements, North Korea isn’t supposed to be able to export its coal. That its smugglers have been doing so right under China’s nose is one reason Beijing is in focus as sanctions bear down on Russia.
Chinese companies have repeatedly dodged restrictions on trading with countries like North Korea, Iran and Venezuela, according to sanctions investigators from United Nations panels of experts, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other monitors. A UN panel’s report six months ago, for example, documented how North Korea-connected vessels illegally made 41 coal transfers in about four months just offshore from China’s busiest port.
Western actions to sever many of Russia’s ties to the global economy as punishment for its war on Ukraine could be less effective if China offers Moscow access to what some see as the bazaar of choice for rogue nations.
Sanctions-busting on Russia’s behalf would be large-scale, requiring forthright state involvement such as deals with big government-run firms or the application of laws designed to undermine foreign sanctions. It is typically small-time traders who get involved with North Korea, monitors say.
As the world’s second-biggest economy and its top trading nation, China has the wherewithal to set its own course on sanctions, and its government is reflexively distrustful of U.S.-led rule making. The size and fragmentation of China’s market, with over 5,800 merchant ships, seven of the world’s 10 busiest shipping ports and tens of thousands of bank branches can help hide nefarious activity.
China is also at the cutting edge of developing technology designed as alternatives to Western-backed systems, like a bank money-transfer service modeled on the Swift network and a digital version of its currency, as well as undersea- and satellite-telecommunication links it controls.
Sanctions monitors say evidence suggests Chinese officials sometimes turn a blind eye to evasion. How else, they ask, do North Korean smugglers manage to dodge controls in one of the world’s most efficient surveillance states.
Business licenses, satellite photographs and other documentation in the U.N. panel’s 261-page report support its conclusions that North Korean-flagged and -controlled vessels in waters near the Chinese port of Ningbo between February and May last year illegally unloaded 364,000 metric tons of their nation’s coal onto other ships, including some sailing under Chinese flags.
“China has always earnestly implemented the Security Council resolutions on North Korea and fulfilled its due international obligations,"" its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. It said China had responded to the U.N. panel in a responsible manner and drew attention to the group’s references to the negative impact of sanctions on the livelihoods of North Koreans. The U.N. report quotes China’s government as saying the suspect vessels hadn’t called on its ports and it notes sanctions would continue to have negative humanitarian consequences.
China opposes economic sanctions in part because its officials and companies are frequently targeted, from the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 to U.S.-led efforts to impede Huawei Technologies Co. Research by the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, shows that 70 of the 765 sanction measures adopted by the Biden administration during 2021, including reissues of Trump-era sanctions, had a China dimension.
“If they don’t believe the sanctions are legal and legitimate, there’s no incentive for them to enforce them,"" said Jason Bartlett, who monitors sanctions for CNAS.
While China wants to register its distaste for sanctions, Beijing also benefits when North Korea earns cash to stave off a collapse—a crisis China wouldn’t want on its border—while deals with Iran and Venezuela provide China much-needed crude oil, he said.
Trading arrangements aren’t the only tool Beijing has to undermine a proliferation of Western sanctions.
To challenge Western sanctions, Beijing is also baring its teeth against what it calls interference and long-arm jurisdiction. Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was sanctioned by Beijing last year along with think tanks and companies that China’s government says interfered in its domestic affairs.
Corporate executives who deal with China await nervously a time when Beijing deploys a bevy of new but so-far-unused regulations analysts call antisanction sanction laws. The regulations give Beijing authority to punish individuals and companies for adhering to a foreign government order, such as a technology producer that halts exports to a sanctioned buyer.
Such rules could come in handy if Chinese companies get caught in the crossfire over Russian sanctions.
“We’re just waiting for the moment where some foreign company…gets stuck in the middle of this sanctions antisanctions regime and is put in a place where it’s breaking either Chinese or U.S. law,"" said Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China.
Russia and China are neighbors with nearly $150 billion in trade, and both are led by autocratic leaders facing U.S. opposition to their governance policies. Twenty days before Russia’s invasion, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a statement that blasted as “power politics…bullying, unilateral sanctions, and extraterritorial application of jurisdiction, as well as the abuse of export control policies.""
Asked about sanctions being applied to Moscow, Beijing officials have repeated their opposition.
“China and Russia will continue to conduct normal trade cooperation in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. The country’s top banking regulator asserted China “will not participate in such sanctions.""
Though they don’t carry an international imprimatur like U.N. sanctions against North Korea, the scope of measures aimed at Moscow by the U.S. and Western allies is unprecedented for a major country.
The U.S. and other nations have frozen assets controlled by Mr. Putin, some of his top aides, leading tycoons and companies, as well as government agencies; blocked Russia’s biggest commercial banks from the global financial system; and forbidden trade in key goods and services.
China faces a different calculus in this crisis. Russia isn’t North Korea, an economy so small and isolated that clandestine one-off shipments offer a material benefit.
Russia is a Group of 20 member and the world’s 11th biggest economy. Meaningfully dulling the pain of Western sanctions would require cooperation by banks, shippers and other business groups that in China are generally government-controlled. Each entity taking part risks being sanctioned itself.
“I predict it’ll be deeply effective, including with respect to Chinese companies,"" said Ryan Fayhee, a partner at Washington law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP and a former sanctions expert at the Justice Department. Even if individual Chinese players may be willing to forge workarounds to the restrictions on Russia, Mr. Fayhee said it isn’t clear their bankers, insurers, shippers and other counterparties would go along.
“It’s very difficult to do business alone,"" he said.

"Russia pummels Ukrainian civilian targets ahead of talks4 min read . Updated: 07 Mar 2022, 06:59 PM IST
Russian attacks face fierce Ukrainian resistance, as cease-fire talks are set to resume
Russian attacks face fierce Ukrainian resistance, as cease-fire talks are set to resume
LVIV (UKRAINE) : Russia pursued a pressure campaign in its invasion of Ukraine with nighttime strikes on civilian targets as the war entered its 12th day, while Kyiv’s military held fast along several fronts ahead of planned cease-fire talks.
Continuing their encirclement operations on Ukrainian cities, Russian forces prevented civilians from escaping via humanitarian corridors and shelled urban centers in the country’s north and south. Ukrainian forces continued to frustrate Russia with counterattack and sabotage operations.
Russia’s failure to capture major cities and its mounting loss of aircraft and armored vehicles have increased pressure on Moscow in a campaign that has drawn global ire and sanctions.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, the most important global power to align itself with Russia, said Beijing would work with the international community to provide “necessary mediation"" when required.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were scheduled to meet in Belarus for their third round of talks on Monday, with progress uncertain after earlier agreements to allow civilians to flee the fighting collapsed. Ukrainian negotiators arrived in Poland on Monday ahead of the afternoon meeting.
On Thursday, the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are set to meet in a Turkish resort city, Turkey’s foreign minister said.
With Ukraine’s ability to withstand the barrage amid increasing deprivation in question, President Volodymyr Zelensky, in separate calls with President Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, pressed his case for increased sanctions against Russia and the implementation of a no-fly zone over his country.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has rejected requests for a no-fly zone, saying it would risk war with Russia—an outcome that Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened if any NATO members enter the conflict.
As Russia continued to erase the line between military and civilian targets, Russian forces shot and killed Yuri Prylypko, the head of the village council in Hostomel, outside Kyiv, and two people who were helping him distribute food and medicine, according to the council’s Facebook page. Hostomel was the site of fierce fighting in the war’s early days.
In Kharkiv, near the Russian border, Russia intensified attacks on civilian targets, pressing to subdue a city, Ukraine’s second largest, that remains in Ukrainian control after days of fierce bombardment.
Russia’s concentrated bombardment on civilian sites overnight in Kharkiv killed eight people and set more than 20 buildings ablaze, emergency services said. A Ukrainian counteroffensive retook a town on the outskirts of the city, with Ukrainian officials saying two Russian colonels were killed in the operation.
Elsewhere, Russia has been consolidating gains. In Irpin, to Kyiv’s west, where residents have been without food and water for three days, Russia moved in tanks and motorized infantry units in a sign of what may be in store for the capital.
Russia continued efforts to subdue cities and towns in the Ukrainian south, piecing together a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula and choking off access to the Black and Azov Seas.
Russian forces have nearly encircled the Azov Sea port city of Mariupol, trapping civilians. Aid group Doctors Without Borders described the humanitarian situation in the city as catastrophic.
With food supplies threatened across the country, Ukraine banned exports of staples such as rye, oats, buckwheat, salt and sugar.
During the night, Russia assaulted an airport outside the southern port city of Mykolaiv, using Smerch multiple-rocket launchers to pound civilian targets.
Kyiv said it had destroyed 30 Russian helicopters at an airfield near Kherson, a Russian-occupied city in southern Ukraine.
Missiles launched from Russian ships in the Black Sea struck infrastructure in Tuzla, south of Odessa, which Mr. Zelensky said was the target of a Russian attack, according to plans he said Ukraine has obtained, auguring an expansion of Russian objectives. Russian ships were regrouping on the Black Sea.
“We know that Russian troops are actively preparing to attack Odessa,"" said Mikhail Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential military adviser. “They have already tried to implement this plan. But our defense has managed to hold them back.""
Ukrainian railways scheduled an additional evacuation train out of Odessa for Monday.
In the country’s east, Ukraine blunted a Russian advance in the Luhansk region, trading artillery blasts in the occupied territory and killing nearly 40 soldiers and hitting an oil depot, Ukrainian Interfax news service reported.
Ukraine continued to muster international support. The U.K. announced a $100 million grant to backfill Ukrainian pensions and public-sector salaries, and the U.S. with Australia, Canada and New Zealand called on Interpol to suspend Russian membership.
A Russian government plane left New York carrying a dozen expelled Russian diplomats to the United Nations.

"Russia recruiting Syrians for urban combat in Ukraine, US officials say3 min read . Updated: 07 Mar 2022, 06:01 PM IST
Moscow is looking for help from foreign fighters to take cities including Kyiv
Moscow is looking for help from foreign fighters to take cities including Kyiv
WASHINGTON : Moscow is recruiting Syrians skilled in urban combat to fight in Ukraine as Russia’s invasion is poised to expand deeper into cities, according to U.S. officials.
An American assessment indicates that Russia, which has been operating inside Syria since 2015, has in recent days been recruiting fighters from there, hoping their expertise in urban combat can help take Kyiv and deal a devastating blow to the Ukraine government, according to four American officials. The move points to a potential escalation of fighting in Ukraine, experts said.
It is unclear how many fighters have been identified, but some are already in Russia preparing to enter the conflict, according to one official.
Officials declined to elaborate on what else is known about the deployment of Syrian fighters to Ukraine, the status or precise scale of the effort.
According to a publication based in Deir Ezzor, Syria, Russia has offered volunteers from the country between $200 and $300 “to go to Ukraine and operate as guards"" for six months at a time.
Chechen forces have also been deployed to Ukraine, according to a Reuters report citing Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Fighters are also pouring into the country to fight on the side of the Kyiv-based government. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that 16,000 foreigners have volunteered to fight for Ukraine, part of what he described as an “international legion.""
With volunteers from other countries flowing into Ukraine, the conflict there could become a new center of gravity for foreign fighters, said Jennifer Cafarella, national security fellow at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C.
“The Russia deployment of foreign fighters from Syria into Ukraine internationalizes the Ukraine war, and therefore could link the war in Ukraine to broader cross regional dynamics, particularly in the Middle East,"" she said.
Tens of thousands of Russian troops are inside Ukraine and mortar, missile and other attacks are occurring daily in the northern, eastern and southern regions of the country. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the cities, which were home to roughly two-thirds of the population before the invasion began Feb. 24.
Ukraine remains in the hands of Mr. Zelensky’s government, and the largest cities, Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv in the east, remain under government control. Russia has taken over the port city of Kherson, and Ukraine’s other cities now face an assault from Russia.
Syrian fighters have spent nearly a decade fighting urban warfare, while Russia’s largely conscripted force lacks this skill set. Ms. Cafarella said Syrian forces deployed to Ukraine could also be asked to work a support role, based on how they worked in Syria with the Wagner Group, a mercenary force that some see as a proxy for the Russian government.
Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., questioned how useful the recruits from the Middle East could be in Ukraine. Mr. Lister said there are some Russian-trained Syrians who were involved in hunting members of Islamic State who might be in Ukraine, but generally Moscow didn’t consider Syrian fighters to be good at urban warfare.
“Bringing Syrians into Ukraine is like bringing Martians to fight on the moon,"" Mr. Lister said. “They don’t speak the language, the environment is totally different.""
Russia has been a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since it entered that conflict, largely through airstrikes, as well as Russian armed forces. The Wagner Group, which arrived in Syria shortly after Russia entered the conflict on behalf of the Assad regime, has conducted support operations such as seizing oil and gas fields and securing other government infrastructure, such as airports.
Russia, which positioned nearly 200,000 troops along the Ukrainian border in the weeks leading up to the invasion, said Wednesday 498 of its troops have been killed and another 1,597 have been injured, a rare public admission of battlefield losses. Others have put the figures much higher, including the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff, which, according to a Reuters report, said the estimate for Russian troop deaths was closer to 11,000.

"Iran nuclear deal threatened by Russian demands over Ukraine sanctions4 min read . Updated: 06 Mar 2022, 06:31 PM IST

Iran Nuclear Deal Threatened by Russian Demands Over Ukraine Sanctions
BY LAURENCE NORMAN | UPDATED MAR 05, 2022 12:09 PM EST
Western and Iranian officials have said they were very close to reaching a deal to restore the nuclear pact
Fresh demands from Russia threatened to derail talks to restore the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as Moscow said it wanted written guarantees that Ukraine-related sanctions won’t prevent it from trading broadly with Tehran under a revived pact.
The demands, made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday, came as Western and Iranian officials said they were near to reaching a deal to restore the nuclear pact, which lifted most international sanctions on Iran in exchange for tight but temporary restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear programs.
The U.S. left the agreement in May 2018, and Iran has since mid-2019 massively expanded its nuclear work. The Vienna talks focus on the exact steps that Tehran and Washington would need to take to return into compliance with the deal.
Western officials said they wanted a deal on the nuclear file in place this week. Chief negotiators from European powers left Vienna to return to their capitals Friday as they waited for Iran and the U.S. to try to solve the final differences between them. These included precisely which sanctions Washington would lift.
“We are close,"" Britain’s chief negotiator at the talks, Stephanie Al-Qaq, said Friday before she left.
Advances in Iran’s nuclear work mean Western officials have warned that it could very soon be impossible to restore the 2015 nuclear deal because it would no longer be possible to re-create the central benefit for the U.S. and Europe of that agreement—keeping Iran months away from being able to amass enough nuclear fuel for one nuclear weapon.
A confidential report from the United Nations atomic agency circulated Thursday showed that Iran had now produced 33.2 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, around three-quarters of what it would need to have enough weapon-grade 90% fuel for a nuclear weapon. Experts say it would take Iran just a few weeks to amass enough weapons grade nuclear fuel.
It was always understood by Western officials that Russia’s specific role within the 2015 nuclear deal would need to be protected from sanctions. That includes receiving enriched uranium from Iran and exchanging it for yellowcake, Russia’s work to turn Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility into a research center and other nuclear-specific deliveries to Tehran’s facilities.
However, Mr. Lavrov appeared to demand far more sweeping guarantees that could introduce major loopholes in the tight financial, economic and energy sanctions the West has imposed in recent days because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“We have asked for a written guarantee…that the current process triggered by the United States does not in any way damage our right to free and full trade, economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with the Islamic State,"" Mr. Lavrov said.
Soon after Mr. Lavrov’s comments, Russia’s chief negotiator at the nuclear talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted that he had raised questions that needed tackling with a senior European official “to ensure smooth civil nuclear cooperation with Iran."" That suggested Russia’s real demands at the talks were narrower than Mr. Lavrov had suggested.
A Western diplomat said that if the guarantees are purely about the work Russia would do in Iran under a restored nuclear deal, “that can be managed.""
“But if Lavrov is using this as a play to try to carve a huge hole out of the overall Ukraine sanctions, that’s a different story,"" the person said.
An Iranian official said his delegation was awaiting clarification from Moscow.
Either way, the Russian demands now look set to kick talks into next week, two Western diplomats said.
“In my view, a deal is still more likely than not. Critically, both Washington and Tehran want to get this done,"" said Henry Rome, a director covering global macro politics and Iran at Eurasia Group. “Russia throwing sand in the gears may actually bring these two adversaries together to reach creative solutions to get the deal signed.""
Since talks began last April, Iran has refused to negotiate directly with the U.S. Instead, the other parties to the agreement—Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China and the European Union—have served as intermediaries.
Russia had played a generally constructive role in the talks, Western diplomats have said, at times pulling Iran back from unreasonable demands and pressing Tehran—publicly at times—not to drag the talks out too long.
However, senior Western officials said that over the last few days, with the Ukraine conflict in the background, Russian officials at the talks had been more hesitant, telling their counterparts they needed to check new ideas with Moscow.
While the talks in Vienna appeared to stall again, one potential hurdle to reviving the nuclear deal might have been removed Saturday following a trip to Tehran by Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Mr. Grossi went to Tehran to seek an agreement about the handling of a probe the agency has been doing for three years now into undeclared nuclear material found in Iran. Tehran has been stalling on the investigation and had pushed in Vienna for the files to be closed as part of restoring the nuclear deal, something the agency and Western officials refused.
“So this is why it’s important to have this understanding between us today, which is an understanding to work together, to work very intensely,"" Mr. Grossi said at a press conference in Tehran.

"Australia plans submarine base that can host US vessels3 min read . Updated: 07 Mar 2022, 05:32 PM IST
Facility will also serve as home port for Australia’s nuclear submarines
Facility will also serve as home port for Australia’s nuclear submarines
Australia is planning to build a new naval base on its east coast that could offer resupply and maintenance to American nuclear submarines, increasing the capabilities of both countries in countering China in the Indo-Pacific region.
The facility, Australia’s first full-fledged submarine base on the east coast, will eventually serve as the home port for some of the nuclear submarines that Australia is expected to acquire in the coming decades through AUKUS, a new military partnership with the U.S. and the U.K.
Australia is setting aside more than $7.4 billion for facilities and infrastructure to accommodate the new submarines, including the new east coast base, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday. Australia already has a naval base in Western Australia that houses its current fleet of diesel-electric submarines.
“Establishing a second submarine base on our east coast will enhance our strategic deterrent capability, with significant advantages in operational, training, personnel and industrial terms,"" Mr. Morrison said.
Mr. Morrison, who leads a center-right government with a razor-thin majority in parliament, is down in the polls just months before an expected election, and has been trying to portray himself as strong on national security as a part of his campaign. During his more than three years in office, Mr. Morrison has taken a hard line against China, brought Australia closer to traditional allies such as the U.S. and the U.K., and more recently, harshly criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. has also sought to make Australia more central to its strategy for the Indo-Pacific, where Western nations have become increasingly concerned about China’s assertiveness. During bilateral talks between Australia and the U.S. last year, officials said they wanted to enhance air, land and sea cooperation, including increasing logistics and support capabilities of U.S. naval vessels in Australia.
Aside from the U.S. sharing nuclear-submarine technology with Australia, other components of the AUKUS arrangement include security cooperation in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies and undersea capabilities. Though analysts say there should be concrete developments on those capabilities before Australia’s nuclear submarines are in place, it isn’t clear yet exactly how Australia will benefit in the near term.
“The government is clearly trying to signal that it is moving quickly with AUKUS implementation,"" Ashley Townshend, director of foreign policy and defense at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, said of Mr. Morrison’s announcement Monday. “That’s a positive thing, but it’s also still in process.""
Top diplomats from Australia, the U.S. and the U.K. met last month on the margins of the Munich Security Conference to discuss AUKUS. In addition to talking about nuclear submarines, the parties “noted our collective desire to deepen collaboration on additional advanced military and technology capabilities,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said.
Mr. Morrison said officials reviewed 19 potential sites for the east coast base and settled on three preferred, possible locations: Brisbane, in Queensland state and Australia’s third largest city; Newcastle, northeast of Sydney, which already hosts a major seaport for coal exports; and Port Kembla, which is just southwest of Sydney. Each location is close to key infrastructure needed to support submarines, population centers to grow a uniformed submarine workforce, and maritime training and operational areas, he said.
Mr. Morrison said an optimal base will provide home-ported submarines with specialized wharves, maintenance facilities, administrative and logistics support, personal amenities and suitable accommodation for submarine crews and support staff, including for visiting submarines from allied nations such as the U.S. and the U.K. He added that there are no plans to remove existing or planned capacity from the Western Australia base, which will remain home to current and future submarines given its strategic importance on the Indian Ocean.
Anthony Albanese, the leader of the center-left Labor Party and Mr. Morrison’s chief opponent in the coming election, said his party is supportive of developing nuclear submarines but that the government has been slow to show actual progress.
“Today’s announcement is really an announcement about an announcement,"" he said. “What we actually need is announcements that lead to actual infrastructure and announcements that lead to actual defense materiel being realized.""
